---

## Part 1: Realistic & Detailed Patterns (Original)
*Focuses on high detail, realistic lighting, and cinematic composition.*

### Pattern A: The Silent District (Neo-Noir Realism)
> **Prompt:**
> A hyper-realistic digital painting of a fantasy red-light district at night. The street is lined with brothels and casinos with magical neon signs and lanterns, but the street is unnervingly empty of customers. Many shop shutters are half-closed. In the shadows of alleyways and store entrances, tough-looking bodyguards in suits and leather armor are standing watch with crossed arms. The atmosphere is tense, ominous, and silent. Wet cobblestone streets reflect the colorful lights. Neo-noir fantasy aesthetic. High contrast, heavy shadows, cinematic lighting. 4k resolution.

### Pattern B: The Foreign Shadow (Action Realism)
> **Prompt:**
> A dynamic illustration of an ambush in a dark back alley of a fantasy city. Shadowy assassins wearing exotic, foreign clothing (blending East Asian and Desert Nomad aesthetics) are attacking a high-ranking mafia executive. The executive is a wealthy-looking man in a flashy suit, looking terrified. The attackers are masked and wielding curved blades. Sparks fly from clashing weapons. Motion blur, dramatic angle, intense action. The lighting comes from a single flickering magical street lamp. Anime-influenced semi-realistic style.

### Pattern C: The Aftermath (Cinematic Detail)
> **Prompt:**
> A close-up, impactful shot of a VIP lounge floor in a fantasy nightclub. A shattered glass of expensive wine lies on the rich carpet, the red liquid spilling out like blood. Beside it lies a broken emblem or badge representing the Ironman Association (mafia guild). In the background, out of focus, legs of rushing people or overturned furniture can be seen. A mood of sudden violence and mystery. The lighting is dim and moody. Detailed texture, shallow depth of field, storytelling composition.

## Part 2: Atmosphere & Impressionistic Patterns (New)
*Focuses on mood, concept art style, and abstract feelings. No need for photorealism.*

### Pattern D: The Silent District (Moody Concept Art)
> **Prompt:**
> A moody, atmospheric concept art of a fantasy red-light district at night. The street is empty and silent. Neon signs and lanterns glow in the mist, but the shops are closed. Dark silhouettes of bodyguards standing in the shadows. High contrast, heavy noir atmosphere, rough brushstrokes, dark and mysterious colors. Sense of tension and silence.

### Pattern E: The Foreign Shadow (Abstract Sketch)
> **Prompt:**
> An abstract, dynamic sketch of a back alley ambush. Shadowy figures with curved blades attacking a man in a suit. Motion blur, chaotic lines, sense of speed and violence. Dark background with a single dim light source. Not detailed, but capturing the intensity of the moment. rough style, dark fantasy atmosphere.

### Pattern F: The Aftermath (Loose Art Style)
> **Prompt:**
> A moody still life illustration of a spilled glass of red wine on a dark carpet. Beside it, a broken badge. Dim lighting, melancholy atmosphere. Focus on the colors red and black. Loose artistic style, storytelling mood, suggestion of violence without showing it directly.
